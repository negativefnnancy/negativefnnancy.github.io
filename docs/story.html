mommy always told me (while wiggling her finger at me) "if a baddie comes in the house at night, and you're all alone, there's a baseball bat under your bed." so i've always slept comfy in my PJs, snuggly tucked in under my fluffy blankets (mommy's work, only the best) and smothered between the cuddles of allll my stuffies, and had no worries, because the baseball bat under my bed is my guardian angel (it even says "ANGELS" on it) radiating a protective energy bubble shield (it's blue, my second favorite color) that keeps me safe and gives me sweet dreams.
</p>
<p>
tonight was like any other in THAT regard. however, i don't normally wake up in the night (i have a exceptional bladder, the doctor told it to me, no, i would never wake up for THAT reason):
</p>
<p>
i woke up because i heard some shuffle shuffle sounds (which surely were NOT my stuffies shuffling themselves across the carpet to get to the pottie before they wee wee on themselves). i tumbled my head over and wiped out the sleepy from my eyeballs so i could see, and i DID see, and it was a big ol man opening up one of my drawers (trying to clean it, like mommy, i bet). he was holding a big bag of toys flung over his shoulders like in all the drawings of santa clause (who isn't actually like that at ALL, by the way, don't let the grown ups fool you into thinking it! <em>I</em> met santa myself one day when i had a fever. he brought me medicine on a broom stick, and was actually green and short and said he lives in the garden.) except HE was wearing a bunch of itchy looking black clothes and had his beanie pulled down over his whole entire head! THAT is so silly, i started giggling and couldn't stop myself, a sleepy sort of giggle.
</p>
<p>
i think he definitely had good earballs, because even though his earsockets must have been all muffled up by his silly beanie, he stopped moving right then and there and turned his head over in my direction, that way i could see his two little neatly cut eyeball holes on his beanie over his face. he was really good at being silly, because that got me giggling even harder than before.
</p>
<p>
i suddenly figured out that he definitely thought we were playing a game of red light green light and that i had called red light, because he was just standing tere doing absolutely NOTHING for a whole kid hour. (kid hours are like dog years, in case you didnt know that, except its where a whole minute feels like a whole hour instead.) i was feeling nice so i decided not to make him endure a whole nother kid hour like that (i know how hard it is to be still) so i hastily yelled, "grin lah!" and i'm proud to say that i was well understood, despite my thumb being ALL the way in my mouth--
</p>
<p>
which just goes to show that sucking your thumb really isnt at ALL as bad as grown ups THINK it is: my dah dah always tells me that i'm a big girl and that big girls dont suck their thumbs. well i quite agree with that! that i am a big girl, that is! six whole YEARS big in fact (and not kid-years either!) however i do KNOW (from experience) that suucking your thumb isn't going to make you any littler, no matter how big you are, otherwise i'd be growing DOWN instead of UP. for sure, you'll never catch a grown up sucking THEIR thumb, but this is just pretense for their little game that they play. you see the grown ups have grown up MEETINGS after school that kids arent allowed to, and this is where they decided that they would team up and play a big prank of epic proportions on the children, i'm sure of it. but <em>I</em> like to think that every grown up WOULD enjoy sucking their thumb just as well as i do, and surely some DO, behind closed doors. you can't believe everything grown ups tell you, you know. that's what <em>I</em> think (and i thought it for a very long time, so it must be right). but now you've let me be distracted from my story!
</p>
<p>
--i KNOW he understood, because at once he started moving again, and the very first thing he did was shut my drawer back shut. (that's how you know he was a grown up, they always tell you to leave things as you found them. <em>I</em> never understood it.) and then he tried walking to my door, but he must have still been thawing out from having been frozen for such a long time, because he walked SO slow (like a tortoise. and this is how i KNOW he would win a race against me, because slow and steady wins the race, and i've never walked so slow in my whole life. but now i know his secret, and if im ever put up against one of my play mates in a race, i'll just make sure we play red light green light FIRST, and that my play mate is to be the stop light and is to be in a particularly stop-y mood.)
</p>
<p>
he nearly managed to reach my door just when i realized i didn't want silly beanie head to leave just yet. i sat up on my bed, leaned forwards, and whispered "reeeeeed liiiiiight!" he turned back to ice again, and i stared down his bag of toys dangling over his shoulder across his back. <em>I</em> wanted to know what kind of toys he had in tere, so i eagerly wriggled out from under my warm blankets and mountain of stuffies, carefully scooted myself off the edge of my bed and landed on all twos. (i spent 13 whole entire MINTUES the oter day jumping off the cliff in the family room with my cat, so i got pretty good at landing on my feet i think.) and i administerd all the way over to the toy bag (administered is a brand new word i learned in the dictionary recently. it said "to run, for example, at the head of a firm" and i did run i tell you, at the head of a firm old man wearing a scratchy beanie, who would surely scold me, if i did anything TERRIBLE enough)
</p>
<p>
"BOO!" i tried to scare him, to get his attention. (i know about a hundred ways to get people's attention (i counted so you dont have to) and this was my favorite) he slowly turned about half way around and looked at me (not thawed out enough yet, i'm certain, to turn the whole way) and he broght his finger to his mouth to make a "shhh" sound with it.
</p>
<p>
duhhhhh! how silly of me, it's the middle of the night, and i didn't want to wake up mommy and dahdah. so i told him (in a WHISPER this time), "i want to play with your TOYS!" and i patted on the hard edges of the toys protruding from the bag to make myself clear. but he shook his head in his icy manner (in the NO direction, not the YES direction, i know <em>I</em> always get them mixed up).
</p>
<p>
grown ups always act like they are too busy to play, but if you are persistant enough they ALWAYS give in. besides, i know they secretly do want to play, they can't fool me. and certainly HE has been playing quite a good ice sculpture the entire time i've known him.
</p>
<p>
"you're a tortoise!" i whispered, mockingly sticking my tongue out at his FACE. blehhh! and i dashed to the middle of my room and turned around to face him wit my CLAWS drawn into the air. i know i looked very scary becaues my pjs are red like EVIL. and i was being a evil frog and hopping around and growling fiercely, quite forgetting to be quiet again. "i will EAT you if you don't play with me!!"
</p>
<p>
i know i got him in the playing mood now because he started flailing his hands out in front of him and shook his head again, as if to say 'no! anything but that! i will play with you!'
</p>
<p>
contented with having persuaded him into caring his toys with me (sharing is caring), i plopped down in the middle of my room and spread my hands in front of me across my play rug signalling to him to come over, and i whispered "bring your toooooooysUH!"
</p>
<p>
he took a moment to glanc over his shoulder and look out the door (to speed up the thawing process no doubt) and then he tippy toed his way over to the play rug and crouched down. at LAST! he reached into his toy bag to pull something out, all while repeatedly glancing his head around (i could tell he really wanted to thaw out quickly so we could play!). i knew it was gonna be good and i couldnt WAIT to see what kinda stuff he had!
