Gosh, I can&rsquo;t remember what that teacher&rsquo;s name was XD
</p>

<p>
Anyway we were visiting the other first grade classroom, and we were doing arts and crafts. I remember drawing lots of intricate and detailed patterns and being told that it was so creative! I think this left an impression on me, to know that I could be creative.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, I was also told I was creative when I wrote a little story in first grade in music class, and at the end of the day when I was being picked up, my teachers and parents were talking about how my stories were so interesting.

I did go to daycare on occasion roughly between ages of 2 and 4. I have vivid memories: I wasn&rsquo;t very extroverted at all. I kept to myself and simply did what I was told. From my own memory, I didn&rsquo;t dislike the environment for the most part, but found it little more than merely tolerable. I was generally too timid to interact with the other kids. But on one occasion towards the end of the day, I ended up playing with blocks and cars in a small group (and enjoyed it!). When my grandparents picked me up that day, I told them that &ldquo;I played,&rdquo; and they were proud of me. There was another instance where I remember one of the caretakers describing quite a frightening situation that would occur if any of us were found with a gun. She said something like this: &ldquo;The police would come storming in the building, and we could have to run outside and get behind trees because they would be shooting at us.&rdquo; This was so scary to me! I couldn&rsquo;t wait to get out of there that day.
</p>

<p>
My dad accounts a day when he dropped me off and noticed that while all the other kids were loud and energetic and interacting amongst themselves, I was standing against the wall and cowering my head behind my arms. Right after he drove off, he decided he had to come back and pick me back up because he had seen that I wasn&rsquo;t happy.
</p>

<p>
I do have particularly pleasant memories of naptime wherein the classroom was dark, and there was some very sweet music with lovely singing. It wasn&rsquo;t until I was 15 before I found new music that triggered similar overwhelming feelings of serenity and tenderness. One time in particular, I remember it was autumn, and I woke up from what must have been some very nice REM sleep. I remember the feeling of having returned from the far away world of dreams and the first thing I saw was the autumn trees outside, just before my mom walked in to pick me up. It was really pleasant!

<p>
When I was 5 years old, I had been set up for false expectations for what &ldquo;normal school&rdquo; was going to be like. My first time in the kindergarten room was before school officially had begun, it was for some kind of &ldquo;testing.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what it was, but in retrospect it seemed vaguely like an IQ test. The whole class was allowed to play in the classroom (a trailer building just outside of the main school building), while one person at a time was chosen for the testing. I really enjoyed my time there because it was filled with toys to play with all around the classroom, and I enjoy the &ldquo;testing&rdquo; as well. When I was tested I remember vaguely having to identify some kinds of shapes as well as having to remember three names (of people) being told to me in succession and recite them back. Upon being asked, I was only able to remember two of them, but after I was done being tested, I remembered the other one. When I left school that day, I couldn&rsquo;t wait to go back, and counted down the 7 days remaining until it began.
</p>

<p>
When school did officially start, I was confused how it wasn&rsquo;t at all like testing day. I didn&rsquo;t like it as much, but I found it tolerable at least. I was an extremely obedient kid. Getting in trouble was the worst thing in the world to me, and I was very patient and calm. I never spoke unless spoken to. On the wall there was a &ldquo;traffic light&rdquo; system for keeping track of everyone&rsquo;s attitude that day. At the beginning of the day everyone started off with a green light, meaning they&rsquo;ve been well behaved for the day. The first time someone got in trouble, they would have to turn their light yellow, to signify they had been a little bit bad. The second time, they would have to turn it red, to signify that they had been very bad.
</p>

<p>
I can&rsquo;t quite remember whether I never had to change my light from green at all, or if I had to do it once. It might have been that I did change it once due to something that was blamed on me but out of my control, and that I remember feeling how odd the experience was walking over to that part of the room that I never went to. Or it might be that it was the person who sat to my left, Rebecca, who was also very well behaved, and I only remember having to change her light once the entire year. The reason she had to change her light, by the way, was not understood to me. To my perception, she was simply looking under the table, when the teacher stopped by the table and asked her disapprovingly, &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; to which she gave the teacher a blank guilty stare, and the teacher told her to go change her light. That I didn&rsquo;t understand this disturbed me. It frightened me that it was possible to get in trouble without clear reason, that there are ways to get in trouble that I might not be able to avoid due simply to not knowing about them to begin with!
</p>

<p>
One day, in the cafetorium at the end of the day, sitting with my classmate Austin waiting for our parents to come pick us up and take us home, he asked me if I would like to go out on the playground with him. It was a new idea to me, going out on the playground after school, but it seemed reasonable, and nobody had ever mentioned that it was off limits. And plus I was with a friend, so I felt like it was okay, even though I did feel off about it. We played around for a bit until my teacher and my dad came walking across the parking lot looking for me, worried. They explained to me that it was okay for Austin to do this because his family knew where he was, but that I shouldn&rsquo;t do this because my family expected to find me in the cafetorium. I took this to heart and never dared to venture into an unexpected place at an unexpected time again.
</p>

<p>
One time we had a challenge amongst the class. A special guest had brought in wires coated in fuzz, the kind you use in arts and crafts, and she taught us her method of winding them into a spider figure. The whole class was to try their hand at it, and the best would get a prize. I was confident in my results (and in retrospect, I probably would have won the prize), but the kid who sat across from me, I think his name was Neddis? (Although in retrospect this is a very unusual name, so I&rsquo;m not sure!), told me to &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;, urgently pointing behind me, tricking me to look away so that he could snatch my spider away from me and ruin it. I was very upset at this! I learned to be more suspicious and careful about people at that moment!
</p>

<p>
In general, I didn&rsquo;t terribly hate being there in school, but I didn&rsquo;t particularly enjoy the school work. It was very uninteresting to me, but I did it anyway without any problems. I got mostly perfect grades, which I didn&rsquo;t realize was noteworthy until at home my dad boastingly told me to tell my grandparents what sorts of grades I got.
</p>

<p>
Every day there would be a period of naptime. I never understood it because I was never sleepy in the daytime like the other kids. I just lay there on my mat and observed everyone in the dark and silence. One unusual day, the teacher left the room during naptime. The instant the door closed the whole class ruptured into chaos. Screaming, jumping, throwing things. I knew this would happen, but I couldn&rsquo;t fathom participating in it. I also knew that because they reacted a little too quickly, that the teacher being still right outside the door would notice. And she immediately opened the door again and gave the class a stern look, and everybody froze and got back on their mats. This time she left, and they waited a few seconds before returning to chaos. What was interesting to me was that the teacher acted as if she knew this would happen. She expected the kids to behave in ways that needed to be corrected. As if we are all wild beasts that are meant to be tamed.
</p>

<p>
Once we were working on a coloring assignment for which we had to color in specific regions on the page with designated colors from our crayon box. There is a particular crayon in a set of Crayola crayons called &ldquo;green yellow&rdquo; which appears to be a particularly yellow shade of green, but on paper appears much more yellow (due to the translucency of the wax). To the cultural knowledge of the children, this crayon can be used inconspicuously as a substitute for yellow, e.g. in the event that you lost your actual yellow crayon. The teachers didn&rsquo;t know the difference on paper. However, for this particular assignment, we were meant to use yellow. One kid across the room was using this green yellow crayon for this task. The teacher saw this and angrily ripped the crayon out of his hand, saying &ldquo;Does this look like yellow to you?&rdquo; Much of the class tried to chime in and explain that it really does show up more yellow on paper than it looks, but of course she wasn&rsquo;t having it. Pftt!
</p>

<p>
I noticed that sometimes the pencil lead would break and fall out of the tip of the pencils. I often found it amusing and convenient to write directly with the pencil lead chippings that I stored in my pencil box when I found that my pencil had become too dull. Apparently this was frowned upon, and as soon as I received a sour look from the teacher for doing it, I stopped doing this, even though I found it interesting and it didn&rsquo;t hinder my ability to complete my work.
</p>

<p>
We had another coloring assignment. I had found that I accidentally became distracted while coloring and used the wrong color, oh no! I didn&rsquo;t know what to do, because crayons can&rsquo;t be erased. Or can they? I knew that they couldn&rsquo;t be erased like pencils could, but children in the class often would try to rub their erasers against crayon to erase it anyways. Sometimes it would work, sort of, but not fully. I managed to clear away the crayon just enough that I thought I might be able to get away with coloring over the remnants with the proper color. When I took my assignment up to the teacher, I was scared. She said, without looking at me, in a somber tone, &ldquo;I see what you did,&rdquo; and my heart pumped. I felt terrible, because I didn&rsquo;t mean for it to happen, but I knew I had done something &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; even though it was bound to happen. I didn&rsquo;t mean to zone out, and I did everything I could do to correct it!
</p>

<p>
Everyday at the end of the day we had to copy the contents of the chalkboard onto our paper. I wasn&rsquo;t particularly fond of this, because it wasn&rsquo;t interesting. In fact, I found it to be the most irritating part of the day, having to look up and down and copy small chunks of writing at a time. In retrospect I can appreciate how this must have been good for exercising working memory. Something in the years shortly following kindergarten that I noticed was that I quickly became more tolerant of such copying down writing.
</p>

<p>
One time we were spelling words using magnetic letters on a magnetic board during playtime. Everybody was spelling three letter words by sounding them out. I spelled the word &ldquo;pon&rdquo; but they didn&rsquo;t know what this word was. I told them, it&rsquo;s a small body of water! And they told me that that is actually &ldquo;pond!&rdquo; And told me good job for spelling a four letter word. Some other words that I remember having alternate phonetics for at the time were &ldquo;thix&rdquo; (fix) and &ldquo;lellow&rdquo; (yellow).
</p>

<p>
Out on the playground for recess, there was a large log in the middle of the field where children would have to sit in the sun if they got in trouble. I didn&rsquo;t know this at the time, and I saw my friend Meghan who was our next door neighbor sitting on it. So I went up to sit next to her and ask what she was doing. She told me she was in trouble and was sitting on the log, and that I should probably get up so they didn&rsquo;t think I was also in trouble. I felt strange knowing that I had just sat down on the &ldquo;log!&rdquo; From that moment on the log had an off-limits aura to me. I felt I had to stay away because it had special purposes and they weren&rsquo;t purposes I should get involved in.
</p>

<p>
One day, we were in a neighboring class for a special event. A caretaker found a &ldquo;revolver&rdquo; in the backpack of one of the other classroom&rsquo;s students. I remember hearing the word &ldquo;revolver&rdquo;, but I remember seeing a red device with spheres attached to the ends via strings of some sort, like some sort of strange nunchuck. What I heard next frightened me, &ldquo;This is a weapon!&rdquo; I was scared and was glad that the day was nearing its end.
</p>

<p>
Something I found silly was how when children would poorly tend to their work, the teacher would warn them that in first grade, things are different, that they throw your work in the trash in first grade if you don&rsquo;t take it seriously. I thought this was a very strange motivation for tending to your work. It made sense to me that, given that nobody seemed to enjoy doing this work (myself included), that having it thrown in the trash would be welcome indeed!
</p>

<p>
One day it was a special day where everybody was allowed to bring to school a special toy from home to play with during the in-classroom playtime period. I brought my laptop. I called it the &ldquo;little computer.&rdquo; It was my dad&rsquo;s idea for me to bring it, but I thought it seemed fun. Although it felt strange. It felt very strange to see such a fond &ldquo;homely&rdquo; object in the classroom, it just didn&rsquo;t feel like it belonged. The way that I interacted with the laptop in the classroom during playtime wasn&rsquo;t the same as it was at home, it felt unnatural. I felt that the way you play with toys is different from the way you play with a computer. I felt that the computer required much more introverted attention that was possible in a classroom filled with so many other chaotic people. I sat at a desk that the teacher arranged for me, and there was a chair next to me for one classmate at a time to join me under the vague pretense of playing on the computer together. I didn&rsquo;t know how to facilitate this, so I worked on my level designs while the classmate next to me would simply watch in still silence. A few times I tried to show the classmate how to do something, but they didn&rsquo;t seem to respond. I thought it felt like such a strange environment to be using the computer, because time was limited, the room was noisy, and it wasn&rsquo;t an ideal situation for getting focused on an activity on the computer.
</p>

<p>
A small memory that is amusing to me is that I remember one day forgetting what the lowercase &ldquo;h&rdquo; looked like. So I looked around the classroom walls which were decorated with letters among all sorts of other educational things to find the &ldquo;h&rdquo; so I could remember. Many times since then I have looked back upon that memory in retrospection to try and rekindle that unique feeling of not quite knowing the latin alphabet yet. It&rsquo;s interesting to me how you only ever experience something for the first time, one time. That initial experience can never be revisited, because with each subsequent visit, you are destroying your unfamiliarity, destroying the very experience you are trying to revisit. The brain of course spontaneously and creatively forms its own impressions of unfamiliar structures to fill the gaps, and those transient artifacts of mental processing are easily forgotten in favor of the stable familiarity that eventually forms. I like to hold onto those fragments of prematurely formed perceptions as relics, because, like dreams, they are nebulous and wonderful.

One time we were by the bathrooms. The class was using the bathroom, washing their hands, and taking drinks from the water fountains. I had already had my drink from the water fountain, but I was still thirsty, so while I was washing my hands, I decided to take a drink from the water faucet. I didn&rsquo;t realize there was a difference in these waters and what they were good for. I saw the teacher look at me and shake her head in disapproval and tell me not to do such a thing. I didn&rsquo;t ever try it again.

After three months of summer vacation (which at the time felt like a lifetime), I was back in school. But I didn&rsquo;t realize it would be different. I might have been told that I was now going to be in first grade rather than kindergarten, but I didn&rsquo;t realize that meant a new classroom and a new teacher, so I was surprised to see the change.
</p>

<p>
Where in kindergarten we sat at round tables of four, in first grade we sat in clusters of desks of 4 or 6 or so. The clusters were oriented inwards so that we could see our cluster-mates&rsquo; faces. (I am glad that we had arrangements like these rather than a typical grid of desks. Grids are so much more boring.) In kindergarten we stayed in the same seat for the entire school year. In first grade though, we sometimes switched it up. This was a point when it occurred to me how wonderful change was. To this day, I thrive on change and continuously changing my environment and seeing things from new perspectives. Whenever I am low, simply rearranging my room has always been a quick and reliable pick-me-up. I also experienced this at home in general growing up a lot. My mom would regularly rearrange the furniture, and I am thankful for this because it was very pleasant and stimulating.
</p>

<p>
In first grade we only spontaneously switched things up rather than having a set schedule for doing so. In the first part of the year, there was a lot more switching up than later on. I imagine a lot of this had to do with figuring things out initially. I remember one time I felt lucky enough to be sitting by an empty desk that was going to be claimed soon by a friend who was returning to school. It always felt so exciting to be lucky enough to be able to sit by friends in the classroom.
</p>

<p>
One day, a classmate named Daniel showed me his toy car and wanted me to bring a toy to school to trade with him. This frightened me because it was out of the ordinary, but I didn&rsquo;t see any reason why not. So the next school day, I found a toy and put it in my pocket. My dad questioned it in the car on the way to school, and I felt my heart sinking. I decided I had made a mistake and told Daniel on the playground that I didn&rsquo;t want to trade anymore. He didn&rsquo;t understand, but ultimately stopped asking about it.
</p>

<p>
Daniel was one of the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; kids. He was always disobeying the teacher and bullying people. Often while walking to and from the playground he would step on the back of my feet and breathe jolly rancher breath into my face. There was another girl in our class, Georgie, that he particularly bullied all the time. It was always interesting to me to see how someone could display such chaotic behavior despite the consequences of hurting others and getting in trouble. I couldn&rsquo;t stand these things. I much rather keep quiet and obedient.
</p>

<p>
Once my finger had gotten squished between my chair and the chair of my neighbor. My immediate reaction was &ldquo;Ow, ow, ow!&rdquo; and it took a few seconds before the chair was released and my finger freed. By this time I was in tears and crying, so the teacher told me to go to the office to get care from the nurse, so I did. This was one of the only times that I ever had to go to the office. Most people went to the office for being bad.
</p>

<p>
Once the class was walking in the hall behind the teacher. I accidentally bumped into Austin and we electrostatically shocked each other. I was used to this. But Austin walked up to the teacher and told her poutingly that I had shocked him. The teacher smiled and told him that such things can&rsquo;t always be helped.
</p>

<p>
Once I was watching the clock on the wall behind me in anticipation of lunch. The teacher noticed this and playfully asked if that&rsquo;s what I was doing. I felt embarrassed and denied this. This was a habit that I often had when I was younger. I would deny and lie about things that didn&rsquo;t have consequences and that would never be suspected. One case in particular that I remember is that I insisted to my mom that I loved green peas, when in fact I disliked them. To me the inconspicuous lie was more interesting than the cost of having to eat more green peas that I didn&rsquo;t like.
</p>

<p>
Oftentimes in first grade if we weren&rsquo;t busy doing much of anything, some of the students would ask the teacher for some paper that they could draw on. I loved drawing, and wanted to venture to ask the teacher for paper to draw on once as well. I had to be a bit brave because it was outside of my normal, but I did. Unfortunately I was denied and told that &ldquo;We&rsquo;re about to do something.&rdquo; This caused my heart to sink. This is one of the earliest instances I can remember of feeling strongly discouraged by rejection of any sort, even in the case of a rather benign flavor of rejection. I never asked again.
</p>

<p>
Once in P.E., we went to the nearby tennis court where an instructor introduced tennis to us. He told each of us to hold the tennis racket with the hand that we write with. This was the first time the concept of handedness occured to me. I had been confused and somehow interpreted him as saying that if you write with your right hand, use your left hand, and vice versa. I think what had happened is that he was standing facing us, and was mirroring himself when showing which of his hands was his &ldquo;right&rdquo; hand and which was his &ldquo;left&rdquo; hand. He probably assumed that we would not understand that because he was facing us, that his directions and our directions would be reversed. But I assumed that he really was showing us to use our right hand if we write with our left, and vice versa. So when he came to me and asked which hand I wrote with, I somewhat confusedly showed him my left hand. Unfortunately, because I am right handed, and because my motor skills in my left hand were much less developed, I suffered playing tennis this way. I remember strongly wishing I could use my right hand instead so I could really show them how well I could hit the ball, but I felt that I was being told otherwise, and that I should never disobey.
</p>

<p>
Once in the library class, a similar sort of strange confusion happened. The librarian was telling us that in some instances, &ldquo;Monday&rdquo; was considered the start of the week. She then proceeded to ask us what the first day of the week was. Of course we all knew that the first day of the week was Sunday, but in light of this confusing new information, most of us didn&rsquo;t know what to think, myself included. I found it strange that she bashed us after this telling us how pitiful it was that we didn&rsquo;t even know the first day of the week.
</p>

<p>
One of the major mantras repeated throughout the school was &ldquo;No talking!&rdquo; This was incredibly confusing because on the one hand, people would often be seriously reprimanded for speaking at the wrong times, but other times, when people would speak seemingly out of line, the teachers would engage normally without repercussions. This scared me, and I decided to never risk it, so I never talked at all unless spoken to by an adult, or on the playground or a lunch.
</p>

<p>
Once when the class wasn&rsquo;t busy, Georgie spontaneously engaged with me and started making a book with me. I felt uneasy because this was outside of the class schedule and I was worried I might get in trouble. But I nervously played along with her and we both drew pages in the book. She was in charge, mostly. She told me what we were doing and what I should draw, and I followed her instructions. Then she gave me the book to take home. I felt awkward about this. When my parents asked what I did at school that day, I nervously showed them the book. They thought it was nice, but I felt uncomfortable because I was afraid that they would discover that it wasn&rsquo;t part of the class schedule and that I would get in trouble.

<p>
When second grade began, the teacher told us that we were the most well behaved class she&rsquo;s ever had. This had an impact on us and I&rsquo;m certain that this actually encouraged us to continue to be well behaved for the rest of the school year. She also mentioned that this was quite in contrast to her previous class, and that her previous class had a bully in it. She asked us if we knew what a bully was. It was the first time I had heard of the word. It was interesting to me how this description of a bully made it seem like a discrete role that a person undertakes, rather than a trait on a continuum, and how once you&rsquo;ve acquired this discrete role, you become locked into it by your reputation.
</p>

<p>
Once on the playground, we were outside for particularly a long time. I was having a particularly fun time with my friend. We were both so intensely focused on playing that we didn&rsquo;t even notice when the class went in. We didn&rsquo;t even notice when a classmate was sent to tell us that we were coming in. At some point we looked around and noticed that the teacher was gone, and our classmates were too. I got scared. I saw my first grade teacher sitting on the bench and asked her if my teacher had gone in, and she said she had. So my friend and I went inside and caught up with the class. They were lined up at the water fountain getting the routine drink of water after recess. The teacher confronted us and asked us why we didn&rsquo;t come in when the rest of the class was, and why we supposedly ignored the person who tried to bring us in. We were both very confused because we weren&rsquo;t aware of any of this. Nonetheless we were punished by losing our water privileges for the day.
</p>

<p>
One day on the playground I was feeling unusually excitable. I started losing myself and my sense of caution. I did something a bit daring and kissed my friend Hayden on the cheek. This had major unexpected consequences. My friend immediately backed away and tried to avoid me. Then he told classmates what had happened. Soon enough the whole playground knew what had happened and was in an uproar. The teacher was oblivious to this. This awkward attention caused me to further lose my composure. I didn&rsquo;t know how to handle it, so I began putting dirt in my mouth. I sat under the jungle gym and classmates would come and go to ask me if it was true what had happened. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s eating dirt,&rdquo; one kid told her friend. My friend threatened to take back his invitation to his birthday party. I awkwardly insisted I wouldn&rsquo;t do it again, and he told me it was okay, even though all of the other kids thought I was disgusting. I was so worried that the teacher would find out about this. I was hoping we would go inside and it would be forgotten about. Unfortunately, just as we were lining up to go inside, Anna hopped in front of the teacher to tattle on me. And the story had already been twisted into something more. The rumors were now that I had kissed my friend on the lips. My heart pumped. My teacher immediately turned to me and asked me sternly, &ldquo;Do you think that&rsquo;s something you should be doing?&rdquo; I shook my head, because I knew from her tone what the answer was supposed to be. Then she said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want any touching, any kissing, nothing. Do I need to tell your parents about this?&rdquo; I shook my head, that would be horrible! The whole time I had just been wishing that I could redact what had happened. But once it had happened there was no taking it back and the dominoes of consequences that followed.
</p>

<p>
I was hoping that once we went inside that day that it would be the end of that. Unfortunately nobody forgot about it, and before long, the whole school had heard the rumours. People would spontaneously come up to me and ask if it was true. I wouldn&rsquo;t respond. At lunch, the whole class sat on the other end of the lunch table to avoid us, leaving me and Hayden by ourselves on the other end. I was okay with this, and Hayden was too. We spent the entire lunch time making up stories and laughing.
</p>

<p>
One time on the playground, Hayden came to me and told me how the other kids didn&rsquo;t want to be his friend because he was friends with me. But he still wanted to be my friend, so he asked me to pretend we weren&rsquo;t friends around him. I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to handle this.
</p>

<p>
For the rest of the school year I was paranoid that my parents would find out about the rumors. Once my teacher approached my dad when he had arrived to pick me up. I was extremely nervous that she would tell him about what had happened. Fortunately she only told him about good things. I found it interesting how an event could be so prominent in my own mind, and even in the minds of the other kids, while the adults seemed to be completely oblivious to it, and my teacher had seemed to immediately forget about it.
</p>

<p>
Nobody ever told me how to properly adjust my behaviour when I got a cold and runny nose. When I had a runny nose in the classroom, I would often awkwardly attempt to ignore it, letting long strands of mucous slowly grow and hang at the tip of my nose. I hated it. But I was afraid of getting out of my chair and getting a tissue, because people got in trouble for getting out of their seats. One day the teacher noticed it and told me to &ldquo;please&rdquo; come to the desk and wipe my nose with a tissue. I was thankful for this.
</p>

<p>
Once there was a school play. Routinely, the class would go into the cafetorium to practice. It was optional however, and I eagerly opted out. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine being on stage in front of people like that, it was too embarrassing. I was part of a small group of the class who didn&rsquo;t want to participate. We would sit together at a table sometimes for up to a couple hours while the rest of the class practiced. The others in the group had fun interacting with each other. I wanted to interact with them too, but I felt stifled. I felt like it wasn&rsquo;t allowed, because of the &ldquo;No talking!&rdquo; mantra.
</p>

<p>
On the playground, there was an L shaped brick wall hiding a dumpster inside a chain fence cage. Behind the brick wall was off limits, because the teacher wasn&rsquo;t able to see what we were doing. Most of the kids dared to sneak back there when the teacher wasn&rsquo;t looking. I was far too nervous to do this, but I respected the fact that the others were willing. Hayden was willing. Once we were playing a game where I would throw his shoe over the brick wall and he would go and fetch it. But on one turn, the shoe unintentionally ended up on top of the chained fence. Hayden was upset, because he couldn&rsquo;t reach it, and now we would have to go to the teacher, and we would get in trouble. I felt caught in a corner. I couldn&rsquo;t stand the idea of getting in trouble, but I also was so afraid to go behind the brick wall to try and fetch it myself. So ultimately after some hesitation, I found the courage to run behind the brick wall briefly and climb the fence to grab the shoe for him. Luckily, I wasn&rsquo;t seen, and I felt relieved.
</p>

<p>
Throughout most of the school year, most of the class in the classroom largely maintained that image of being well behaved bestowed upon us at the beginning of the year. However, towards the end of the year, we were doing some unusual end-of-the-year activities. The positive mood was getting to everyone, and everyone had started talking more than usual. Surprisingly to myself, even I found myself caught up in this craze and was talking to Hayden outloud in the open. It started when one of our classmates was sitting with us and asked Hayden if I ever talked, and that she didn&rsquo;t know what my voice sounded like. He told her that I did talk, I was just quiet. So I started saying some things so she could hear my voice, and I had started talking more comfortably with Hayden. The teacher noticed this and told me and Hayden to stop talking. I felt so shocked that I had let my guard down and began talking without realizing it. It felt bad to hear the teacher tell me to be quiet for the first time in the entire school year.
</p>

<p>
Every week, our teacher would award the well behaved kids with a homework pass. The homework pass was good to be used for one night of no homework. Because I had had nearly perfect behavior since the beginning of the year, I had an enormous collection of them at home. I also never used them. Maybe it was because it didn&rsquo;t occur to me to use them, or that I was afraid of what my parents would think. But towards the end of the year, I realized that I had more than enough for the rest of the year, so I spent perhaps the final month of school doing no homework.
